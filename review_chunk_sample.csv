We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. 

The food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.",0,mh_-eMZ6K5RLWhZyISBhwA
BiTunyQ73aT9WBnpR9DZGw,7ATYjTIgM3jUlt4UM3IypQ,1,1/3/2012 15:28,0,5,"I've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.

For anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).

There is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!",1,OyoGAe7OKpv6SyGZT5g77Q

Eclectic assortment: a large chicken leg, fried jalape√±o, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, fresh melon. All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations. Next to the Clarion Hotel.",0,8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A

Don't let the outside deter you (because we almost changed our minds)...go in and try something new!   You'll be glad you did!",1,_7bHUi9Uuf5__HHc_Q8guQ

Cheese curds were very good and very filling. Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines.",1,bcjbaE6dDog4jkNY91ncLQ
JrIxlS1TzJ-iCu79ul40cQ,04UD14gamNjLY0IDYVhHJg,1,9/23/2015 23:10,2,1,I am a long term frequent customer of this establishment. I just went in to order take out (3 apps) and was told they're too busy to do it. Really? The place is maybe half full at best. Does your dick reach your ass? Yes? Go fuck yourself! I'm a frequent customer AND great tipper. Glad that Kanella just opened. NEVER going back to dmitris!,1,eUta8W_HdHMXPzLBBZhL1A
6AxgBCNX_PNTOxmbRSwcKQ,gmjsEdUsKpj9Xxu6pdjH0g,0,1/3/2015 23:21,2,5,"Loved this tour! I grabbed a groupon and the price was great. It was the perfect way to explore New Orleans for someone who'd never been there before and didn't know a lot about the history of the city. Our tour guide had tons of interesting tidbits about the city, and I really enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended tour. I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed. This tour was one of my favorite parts of my trip!",0,r3zeYsv1XFBRA4dJpL78cw

ZKvDG2sBvHVdF5oBNUOpAQ,B5XSoSG3SfvQGtKEGQ1tSQ,0,3/30/2016 22:46,1,3,This easter instead of going to Lopez Lake we went to Los Padres National Forest which is really pretty but if you go to white rock the staff needs to cut down all the dead grass that invades the rock and the water. I would wish the staff would also clean or get rid of the dead grass that's also living by the water. The water is really green and dirty. Los padres national forest staff need to work hard to maintain this forest looking pretty and not like a dumpster. Even Cachuma lake looks like they put a bit more effort.,1,wSTuiTk-sKNdcFyprzZAjg
